Mini recipes catalog
1. Responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile
2. React/Typescript/Hooks
3. Usually I use Redux for state management, but since there was not much data and not many actions I used Hooks
4. Filtered by protein type if chosen by Select
5. Modal window with props for a quick look at recepies. Closed by clicking away or close icon. Also responsive
6. By clicking 'add recipe' button 1 item adds to the cart
7. Select component is styled with Material UI*

* My initial plan was to use Material UI all over the project, but since there was not much logic to write I styled the most with CSS.

Hope you like it, have a good day
